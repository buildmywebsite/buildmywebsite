        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">Why Every Small Business Needs a Website in 2025</h1>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
            If you're running a small business and still relying only on Instagram, WhatsApp, or word-of-mouth — you're
            missing out. A website isn't just a digital business card anymore. In 2025, it's your <strong>24/7
            salesperson, trust-builder, and marketing engine</strong>.
        </p>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">💡 First Impressions Matter</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Your website is often the <strong>first thing</strong> potential customers see. Without one, they might
                question if your business is real, reliable, or even still running.
                <br><br>
                A well-designed website tells visitors:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>You're serious</li>
                <li>You're professional</li>
                <li>You're accessible</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">📍 You're Always Open</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Unlike your store, office, or phone line — your website works <strong>24/7</strong>, even while you're
                sleeping. People can find answers, view products, or book services anytime.
            </p>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">💰 More Customers, Less Effort</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                With SEO, Google Maps, and good content, a website makes it <strong>easier for new customers to find
                    you</strong>. That means more leads, more sales — even if you're not actively promoting all the
                time.
            </p>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">📲 Mobile = Mandatory</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Most users now visit websites on their phone first. Without a responsive design, you're losing traffic
                and trust. A mobile-optimized site gives users a smooth, easy experience — and keeps them coming back.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">🔐 Build Trust Instantly</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                Having a secure (HTTPS), branded, and professional-looking website tells customers:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 my-4">
                “This business is legitimate and cares about its image.”
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text-gray-600">It also lets you add:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Reviews & testimonials</li>
                <li>Contact forms</li>
                <li>FAQs</li>
                <li>Location details</li>
                <li>Booking or payment options</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                In today’s digital world, <strong>not having a website is like not having a phone number</strong>.
                Whether you're a coach, salon, bakery, or freelancer — a website is an investment that keeps paying off.
